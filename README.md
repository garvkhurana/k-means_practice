Practice Exercise: K-means Clustering on Mall Customer Sales Data
Overview
This repository contains code for practicing the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm on mall customer sales data.

Description
The project implements the K-means algorithm from scratch and applies it to a dataset containing information about mall customers' annual income and spending score. It includes a Python script with the algorithm implementation and a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating its usage with the mall customer sales data.

Files

Dataset
The dataset (mall_customers.csv) contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and purchasing data.
